# GitHub Bingo

Idea, play bingo with GitHub. 

## Implimentation

This is a template repo.

players.yaml is the list of players
When the players.yaml file is updated in main a workflow adds a bingo card issue for each person in the players.yaml file
as the Bingo caller (outside the scope of this repo) calls the numbers, players tick off their numbers.
Whoever ticks off all the numbers has to then open a pull request with a markdown file containing their winning set of numbers.

First to open a pull request wins.
